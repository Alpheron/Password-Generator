My project is PassGen: The Ultimate Password Management System. PassGen is a novel password system that not only generates various passwords according to the user’s constraints of whether or not to include special characters, capitalization, and the number of characters. This generated password is then analyzed under a plethora of mathematical algorithms to analyze the robustness of the password through the measures of entropy, the possible combinations, and the predicted time to crack the password through a Brute Force search using the benchmark of a 4 GHz CPU. Furthermore, other options exist to enter your own password into the application so that the algorithms can analyze any custom passwords. Each password can be copied into the clipboard or deleted, however in the future, all the passwords would be synced to an iCloud account so that they can be reused on other devices. No open-source software was used as every part of this application was custom coded. This project leveraged SwiftUI for any UI elements of this application, but beyond that, everything else was written using the Swift Standard Library’s Math functions. While Python, C/C++, and Objective-C also contain math functions, Swift’s was by far the fastest with a 47% faster execution due to very minimal overhead processing according to the set of comprehensive benchmarks that were run. The inspiration for this application came from the fact that my father’s bank account was recently hacked. The hacker had tried to empty the account by transferring money, but the bank had intervened and had frozen the account. The money was later recovered, but the bank had launched an investigation. During the investigation, it was shown that the hacker used a series of bots to use brute force to guess the password. My application attempts to try to provide a solution where extremely robust and secure passwords can be generated, or custom passwords can be evaluated to ensure their effectiveness. Everyone has data that they want to keep private, and a secure, robust, and strong password is the best line of defense to make sure this data doesn’t get into the wrong hands.

## If you've shared or considered sharing your coding knowledge and enthusiasm for computer science with others, let us know. (350 words)

Growing up with very few resources in hand, I had self-taught myself all the languages I know today. I fully understand how difficult it is in order to learn complicated topics without much help. Equipped with these experiences I try my best to help guide others to avoid the pitfalls I faced when I was younger so this is my form of giving back to my community. Furthermore, I spend almost all of my time coding. As of now, I have mainly been focused on the algorithmic side of programming and have slowly transitioned into Machine Learning. Whenever I see people who are currently going through my path of development, I always try to help out and guide them. So far, my lessons are all free with optional donations to charities at the end of each session. As of now, I have raised over $48,000 for various charities and I plan to continue mentoring other students like this for my entire life. Teaching yourself complicated concepts is extremely challenging but yields a very high reward, but it is very easy to get stuck in various pitfalls and I hope to help these learners. Furthermore, I have also helped create my school's AP Computer Science curriculum and have increased my school’s computer science course and activity participation by 350%. My leadership positions in clubs such as Technology & Robotics, Computer Science, and more, have actively improved the outreach of Computer Science programs and have presented students with many newer opportunities that were not available to them in the past. This year, I worked with professors from UC Berkeley, Stanford University, Harvard University, and many others to design computer science educational pathways to introduce students to programming starting in the 6th grade. Currently, we are reaching out to the various lawmakers who have endorsed our work and we plan on submitting this proposal to Congress in the next 2 to 3 years. Hopefully, our work is able to provide many students the exposure to another field of study and give everyone the skills necessary to light the spark of inspiration and awe.

## If you have one or more apps on the App Store created entirely by you as an individual, tell us about them. This will not influence the judging process. (350 words)

Due to my family’s financial situation, this entire project was written on a second-hand MacBook Pro that I actually earned and bought myself from working very recently. I only had momentary access to other Apple products before I started working part-time with the rest of my family. After that, I bought my first Apple product and this is one of the first Swift apps that I have ever written. However, I was always interested in front-end design and have worked with other open source technologies such as React and am currently in the process of completing two iOS apps written in React Native that will be published to the App Store around July. One of these apps is a simple neurological conditions screening service that uses eye-movement patterns and inferences the likeliness of a neurological condition that was trained on data that I had collected by working with local professors. The other app is an Artificial Intelligence-powered medical diagnosis assistant to help people diagnose conditions by either answering a few questions, recording videos or taking pictures of any formations. I hope that my apps have a large outreach and are able to help many people across the world. I am also working on a Computer Science education app to help teach young students how to properly solve Computer Science problems and teach them how to think algorithmically. This app covers everything from the fundamentals of Computer Science to advanced Machine Learning and iOS App Development. However, I do plan on submitting this app to the App Store when future improvements are made to my submission including website-specific-passwords, and iCloud syncing to enable the use of these passwords through multiple devices. Due to my recent ownership of an Apple MacBook and my passion for front-end development as well as Machine Learning, I am sure that I will be creating and publishing a lot more apps in the future.


## Is there anything else you would like us to know? (350)

From a very young age, winning the WWDC Scholarship/Swift Student Challenge has been a long-term dream of mine that I was not even able to attempt due to my lack of access to Apple products. I have always admired Apple as a company since when I was very young. I still remember watching old iPhone launch recordings and would be mind blown at the innovation that would take place each year. It has been a dream of mine to own one of these products and that has come to me recently. With me recently gaining access to a MacBook Pro, this is my first time attempting to compete in this challenge and I learned a lot while making this application. SwiftUI felt completely foreign to me as most tutorials online describe UIKit. However, with the few tutorials I had found and the determination to learn more, I was able to make this application and would want to improve it a lot more before submitting it to the App Store and continuing with my app development journey. To the people at Apple for making this opportunity possible for us along with all the judges, thank you all so much for this opportunity, and during this competition, I have learned a lot about App Development, UI Design, and many others. This competition inspired me to pursue this field further. Win or lose, I definitely had a lot of fun making this project and I will definitely apply again next year! Thank you all for your time!
